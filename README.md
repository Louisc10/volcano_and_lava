### Difficulty

At first I was in a group of 3 but the other two didn't give what they do until the last day. One of it only say that he will finish his work during the weekend and the other one say that he has a difficulty and has many workload from other courses and say that he will send the code at night but he didn't. So basically the difficult that I found is not has enough time since I need to do the workload of the other two by my self, and has some difficult to find the reference since most of people are using C++ instead of Python or if using python they are using different kind of library. Most of the code are created by trial and error. So the code maybe not very efficient and the result is not as good as what you expect.
